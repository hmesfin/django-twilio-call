Initiate rollback if any of the following occur:

- Error rate exceeds 5% of requests
- Response time increases by more than 50%
- Database corruption detected
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Data loss detected

### Immediate Rollback Steps

#### 1. Stop Traffic to New Version
```bash
# Kubernetes rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/django-web -n django-twilio-call

# Docker Compose rollback
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --scale web=0
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml.backup up -d
```

#### 2. Verify Service Health
```bash
# Check application health
curl -f https://yourdomain.com/health/

# Check all services
kubectl get pods -n django-twilio-call
```

#### 3. Database Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Restore from backup (CRITICAL - data loss possible)
pg_restore -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME latest_backup.sql

# Verify data integrity
python manage.py check --deploy
```

### Communication During Rollback
